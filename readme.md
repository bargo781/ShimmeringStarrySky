Shimmering Starry Sky

This is a simple JavaScript code snippet that generates a shimmering starry sky effect. It creates an HTML canvas and draws twinkling stars within it.

Usage
1.Setup: Copy the code from index.js into your project directory.

2.Integration: Include the index.js file in your HTML document using the <script> tag.
<script src="index.js"></script>
3.Execution: Open your HTML file in a web browser to see the shimmering starry sky effect.

Description
The code dynamically creates an HTML canvas element and utilizes the Canvas API to draw twinkling stars. Each star is represented as a small white square moving horizontally across the canvas. The stars twinkle by resetting their position once they reach the right edge of the canvas, creating an illusion of movement.

Customization
Number of Stars: You can adjust the number of stars generated by modifying the loop iteration in the code snippet.

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  stars.push(new Star());
}

Star Size and Speed: The size and speed of the stars can be customized by adjusting the values within the Star class constructor.
class Star {
  constructor() {
    this.x = Math.random() * canvas.width;
    this.y = Math.random() * canvas.height;
    this.size = Math.random() * 3; // Adjust star size
    this.speed = Math.random() * 0.2; // Adjust star speed
  }

  // ...
}

Compatibility
The code should work in modern web browsers that support the HTML canvas element and the JavaScript requestAnimationFrame method.
